# Hotstar Ad Muter

This tiny browser extension auto mutes certain ads in live sport streams on Hotstar like IPL by intercepting Hotstar's ad tracking pixels. It also dynamically determines how long to mute by guessing the duration of the ad from the ad identifier.

Provides respite to your ears by muting the following ads out of the box: **Parle Marie, Vimal Elaichi, Kamla Pasand, My11 Circle, Poker Baazi, Policy Bazaar**.

Note: I made this browser add-on for personal use and may add or remove ads to mute in the future from the current ad mute list. Please feel free to fork the repo to add your own customizations or read the customize section to add your own custom ad mute lists.

## Customize


### Mute all Ads 
You can set the `MUTE_ALL_ADS` variable in `background.js` to `true` to mute all the ads.

### Mute by AD IDs
You can customize which ads are muted by modifying the `targetAdIds` array in `background.js`.  
To add a new ad keyword:

```js
const targetAdIds = [
  "PARLE_MARIE",
  "KAMLA_PASAND",
  "DREAM11",
  // Add your own here
];
```

### Steps to find ad identifiers (Google Chrome):
1. **Open Chrome**, and go to the Extensions page `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find and select `Hotstar IPL Ad Muter` extension. Click on "Details"
3. Click on the section labeled "Inspect views"
4. **During the IPL livestream**, look for the console log `Ad detected:` followed by the `adName`
5. Add full or unique parts ad identifiers you want to mute to the `targetAdIds` array in `background.js`

Alternatively, you can also open your browser dev tools and look for URLs that begin with `https://bifrost-api.hotstar.com/v1/events/track/ct_impression` in the **Network tab** during a live sport stream and get the ad identifier from the `adName` query parameter.

## Caveats
- Sometimes broadcasters try to squeeze in one more ad before the next over begins. If the ad gets cut short abruptly, the live action may stay muted for a few extra seconds before the extension unmutes the tab
- This extension may break if Hotstar change their current tracking pixel URLs or change the format or keywords used in their ad identifiers
